A computer vision approach using CNN

Dataset Information
1. Data Source & Data Link
Dataset Name: Intel Image Classification
Source: Kaggle
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
Description: This dataset contains approximately 25,000 images of size 150x150 pixels, categorized into 6 classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The data is organized into separate folders for training, testing, and prediction. 
2. Libraries Required for the Project
To work with this dataset and build an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the following Python libraries are required:
TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.
Keras: High-level API for building and training deep learning models.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting training history.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (optional, depending on use-case).
OS: For interacting with the operating system, such as file and directory operations.
Shutil: For high-level file operations like copying and moving files.
Scikit-learn: For additional machine learning tools and evaluation metrics.
